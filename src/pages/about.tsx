            In my childhood, I wanted to be a pilot. Because I used to see a lot
            of science fiction movies and seeing those I thought I can also fly
            if I become a pilot

            Later, when I was 11 years old. I suddenly started loving Math and
            Science. I was soo good at match and science that all my friends
            started calling me scientist

            And they kept calling me that till my High school ended. It was a
            very long time. At that time as a Bangladeshi citizen getting access
            to technology was too hard. Like I had my first smartphone when I
            was in class 10 (17 years old). Before that my Aunt bought a Chinese
            phone. I used that to play games and stuff.

            After playing a lot of games I was bored and thought why not make my
            own games. But I didn&apos;t know how to make my own game. I
            searched on the internet and I found nothing. Then I thought, ok
            let&apos;s make mobile apps. I searched for how to make mobile
            games. And I found AppGeyser where you can a template give it a name
            and your app is done. Was too easy but not what I wanted.

            Then I started learning HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Jquery. And I
            made my first web page. That was the beginning and now I&apos; a
            Full-stack web developer and a Python developer.
